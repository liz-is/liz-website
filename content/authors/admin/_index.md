Hi, I'm Liz! I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [Regulatory Genomics](https://vaquerizaslab.org/) group at the [MPI for Molecular Biomedicine](https://www.mpi-muenster.mpg.de/2377/en) in MÃ¼nster, Germany (soon to be at the [MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences](https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/)). My research is focused on understanding the role that 3D organisation of chromatin plays in regulating gene expression. I use R and Python to analyse genomic datasets to better understand how gene expression is controlled during embryonic development. I also sometimes produce these datasets in the lab. My primary model organism is *Drosophila melanogaster*, but I frequently collaborate with researchers working on other organisms, including mouse and human.
